    <h3>
        Serving the High Country since 1992
    </h3>
    <p>Blue Ridge Propane was established in 1992 by Jack Howard and 
family. Jack had previously worked in the propane industry for 25 years for another company.  He then decided that he could provide customers with a better price per gallon and much better customer service if he could work for himself, thus leading him and his wife Frances to decide to go into business for themselves.</p>

<p>Since then Jack has put in a whole lot of hard work and time into this company for over 20 years. His son, Patrick, has been in the company, of course, since day one, but has been in full time employment since 1997.  He is now managing the company so that Jack can start to think about what he might want to do after retirement. </p>

<p>Blue Ridge Propane currently employs 10 people who have a combined experience, not only in this industry, but solely with this company, of over 120 years.</p>

<p>Choosing the right propane company for you and your family is  an easy decision. We know our customers want to deal with people they know and can trust, who can provide quality services and propane at fair and competitive prices.  Blue Ridge Propane is the only locally owned and operated company that serves Avery and a few of the surrounding counties and parts of eastern Tennessee.</p>
