    <h2>5 Questions to ask before hiring a new Propane Gas Company</h2>
    <img src="./php/pics/DSC_0020.png" alt="" />
</div>
<div class="about">
    <h3>1: What are the fees and incentives for new customers?</h3>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, becoming a new customer is never free. There are often
        delivery, installation, and tank rental fees required when you sign on
        to become a customer. Fortunately, many companies that value their
        customers offer incentives to offset sign-on costs. Ask if the company
        offers incentives so you won’t have to pay for more than your propane
        and delivery when you switch.

    <h3>2: What payment and budget plans do you offer?</h3>
    <p>
        Propane is a price-based commodity. There’s no question more tempting to
        ask over the phone with a prospective propane provider than “what’s your
        price?”<br /><br />
        Careful: If you only base your decision on price per gallon, you might
        find yourself signed on with a cheap, low-quality propane gas
        company.<br /><br />
        Instead of judging the face value of the price per gallon, consider how
        the propane company will help you manage payments in the long-term. Ask
        about their payment plan options that help out your monthly budget.
    </p>
    <ul>
        For Example:<br /><br />
        <li>
            Even Monthly Payments – pay the same amount each month for your
            propane bill
        </li>
        <li>
            Pre-buy Programs – avoid price spikes by buying propane in advance
        </li>
        <li>
            Automatic Payments – schedule automatic monthly payments at
            convenient times
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Propane prices change with the seasons. A budget plan, such as even
        monthly payments for a whole year could give you serious peace of mind
        when considering your monthly usage multiplied by fluctuating propane
        prices.

    <h3>3: What other services do you offer besides propane delivery?</h3>
    <p>
        Some propane companies stick to filling up your tank every month and
        sending you the bill. But others have a wider scope of services to help
        you handle emergency situations, ongoing appliance maintenance, and even
        home improvements.
    </p>
    <ul>
        Depending on your home fueling needs, you might conside:<br /><br />
        <li>
            Emergency Delivery – avoid running out of propane when relying on a
            backup generator
        </li>
        <li>
            Gas Line Checks – ensure everyone in your home is safe from propane
            gas leaks
        </li>
        <li>
            Appliance Tune-ups – remember regular maintenance for your propane
            appliances
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        One of the biggest deal breakers is whether a provider offers the
        services you need. Why sign on with a propane delivery company if they
        don’t cover every service you’re looking for?
    </p>

<div class="about">
    <h3>4: Will you help me monitor my usage?</h3>
    <p>
        A propane company that helps you monitor your monthly usage is looking
        out for your piggy bank.<br /><br />
        They may offer an automatic refill program, so you don’t have to worry
        about scheduling refills. Or they may offer a propane tank monitor to
        tell you how much propane you use per month, as well as how many monthly
        refills:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You need to heat your home each month</li>
        <li>You can afford ech month & whether to dial down usage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Hopefully, this question will lead to talk about the resources your
        prospective propane company offers to monitor usage and help you
        moderate it. A propane provider that lends a hand in this way is
        trustworthy and dependable.

    <h3>5: What are the terms if I decide to switch?</h3>
    <p>
        If everything checks out up to this point, great—but don’t forget to
        discuss the details of terminating your contract in case it doesn’t work
        out. You want to avoid hidden termination fees that aim to nickel and
        dime you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only should you consider the cancellation cost, but fees for tank
        removal and propane gas pump out. Some companies will let you keep the
        tank when ending a contract, but they will pump out the propane in your
        tank and charge you for it. Others might let you keep both, others
        remove both and hand you a big bill.
    </p>
    <p>
        Look out for the fine print. Before signing on with any propane company,
        make sure you understand the terms of switching from one provider to
        another.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="about">
    <h3>Smart questions help you find your ideal propane provider</h3>
    <p>
        Write down your propane service “musts” before making any calls and,
        when on a call, always prod for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
        A reliable propane provider will have no problem answering your
        questions (whether it’s over the phone or via a link to one of their
        blog posts). This way, you can feel assured you won’t have buyer’s
        remorse after signing on with a new propane gas company.
